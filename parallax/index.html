            <p class="text">
                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.
                <br> <br>
                And, like paddling, fishing is an ideal low-risk, pandemic-friendly adventure, as proper fishing etiquette already dictates you give other anglers plenty of space

            Mountain Biking Tour in India is yet another scenic expedition that will take riders to the unventured roads. Snow-capped mountains of Manali, rugged terrains of Leh, downhill of Spiti Valley, the bank of River Ganges in Garhwal and lush green hills of Himachal acts as a perfect base camp for a mountain biking expedition in India. These places weave such magic that the air act as a soothing balm for the aching muscles. There are no specific paths granted to bikers, go in whichever direction they want, choose journey as per their wish and set their base at whatever place they like.                <br> <br>
            It's not simple to take your bike wherever you want. You just can't ride it anywhere and everywhere. Mountain biking is a kind of adventure sport which can be enjoyed far off the roads, often of rugged hills and terrains. India caters to all the needs one is looking for to get out of the city life and indulge into nature's beauty.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                <br> <br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.                <br> <br>
The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.            </p>
